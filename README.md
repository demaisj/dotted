# Dotted

**A dotfile management utility**

*Why?* - Because why not. At least I wanted to do something like this and *I knooow* that there is already hundreds of toolkits like this one.

## Installation

As I don't like sharing my dotfiles with third-parties (security & privacy reasons), this repository only holds the lastest version of the toolkit.

To install this toolkit, you'll need to run this installer script. It does verify the compatibility of your system, installs missing packages & creates the *dotted* workspace.
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/demaisj/dotted/raw/master/installer.sh)"
```
